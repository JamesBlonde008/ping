Ping Pong

Program to play ping pong ., 6-9-2017

By Josh Yunker

Description

This is a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 1 to the chosen number with the following exceptions:
Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "ping-pong"
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

Here are the program specs:

If the entered year is divisible by 4 the program will tell you this is a leap year. If the entered year is divisible by 100 the program will tell you this is not a lear year. If the entered year is divisible by 400 the program will tell you this is a leap year. If you enter text instead of a number you will be told that NaN is not a leap year...which is correct.
